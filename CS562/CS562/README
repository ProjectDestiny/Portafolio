# Progress

- There are some sections that talk about adding a layer over the view to draw
controls. I need to review this because it doesn't make much sense.
- There is a whole chapter on full screen applications. I need to review this
later on.

# Outcomes
- I just learned how to include a framework in XCode. First you have to make
one. You have to build it for buth Running and Profiling. You can then drag and
drop (from the finder) the .framework of it, and your project will now have a
reference to it. Since you will be using the binary from it, make sure to include
it in your project's "Embedded Binaries" portion. From there, make sure that
your framework does copy the header files when built by going to your project
settings -> Build Phases and dragging all the Project headers to the public
section (note that these headers should be the same ones you mention in your
master header). This should be it!
