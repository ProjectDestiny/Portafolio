 Multi-threaded rendering on windows:

  How to solve CPU spike after:
    Draw stuff
    SwapBuffers
    Sleep(15)

  This issue is simply solved by doing:

  glFlush();
  glFinish();

  Before calling::

  wglSwapBuffers(dc); // Windows
  glxSwapBuffers(dc, handle); // Linux
  cglFlushDrawable(ctx); // OS X
  Although drivers make a big difference with OpenGL on Windows,
  and Windows still performs far better with Direct3D.
