Project: Proj1
Description: My very first Node.js project structure. Before learning Node.js
             I am looking up how to set up a project directory. This is my
             first attempt at doing so.

Project Structure Reasoning:
  bin: anything that doesnâ€™t fit nicely inside of an npm script (e.g. hooks, ci, etc)

  lib: the components of the application
    |
    |-contains other standalone projects used by the application

  package.json: project-wide dependencies and npm scripts

  index.js: initializes the application
